# Hi, I’m Ifiok

I work in analytics, but my focus is not dashboards, models, or tools. My work centers on decision clarity:

- Define the decision before analysis begins  
- State constraints and trade-offs explicitly  
- Remove metrics that do not change the outcome  
- Design analysis to force a choice, not invite debate  

I’m especially interested in how analytics fails in real organizations, not because of bad data, but because of unclear questions, misaligned incentives, and over-analysis where judgment is required.

## Start here
Decision-Centric Analysis (When Dashboards Fail): https://github.com/ifiok-ebong/decision-centric-analytics

## What I believe about analytics
- Analytics exists to reduce uncertainty around a decision, not to explain everything  
- More metrics often increase confusion, not insight  
- If a result cannot be explained verbally in two minutes, it is not decision-ready  
- The hardest part of analytics is not computation, it is framing  

## Projects (Decision-Centric series)
Each project is designed to demonstrate judgment, not technical breadth.

1) Decision-Centric Analysis: When Dashboards Fail  
Core question: Why do well-built dashboards still fail to drive action?

2) The Cost of the Wrong Question: A Framing Error Case Study (in progress)  
Core question: How do good analysts produce bad outcomes by answering the wrong question?

3) Signal vs Noise: Identifying Metrics That Matter (planned)  
Core question: Which metrics actually change decisions, and which ones decorate them?

## What you will not find here
- Exhaustive dashboards  
- KPI catalogs  
- Predictive models for their own sake  
- Tool demonstrations without decision context  

## Domains
- Strategic insights and BI decision support  
- SaaS retention and revenue analytics  
- Strategy and operations analytics  

If you want analytics that prioritizes judgment over output, you will likely find these projects relevant.
